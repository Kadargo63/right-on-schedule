# Work Day Scheduler 

For this project, I refactored starter code to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day using third-party APIs.
This involved:
- Moment.js
- BootstrapCDN
- Google APIs

I failed to save user input to local storage but will continue to work on this.
